/cto_studio/xuting/miniconda3/envs/table_v1/lib/python3.7/site-packages/torch/nn/modules/rnn.py:70: UserWarning: dropout option adds dropout after all but last recurrent layer, so non-zero dropout expects num_layers greater than 1, but got dropout=0.5 and num_layers=1
  "num_layers={}".format(dropout, num_layers))
Some weights of the model checkpoint at bert-base-uncased were not used when initializing BertModel: ['cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.predictions.decoder.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of the model checkpoint at albert-large-v2 were not used when initializing AlbertModel: ['predictions.decoder.bias', 'predictions.dense.bias', 'predictions.LayerNorm.weight', 'predictions.dense.weight', 'predictions.decoder.weight', 'predictions.LayerNorm.bias', 'predictions.bias']

- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

- This IS expected if you are initializing AlbertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing AlbertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use AlbertModel for predictions without further training.

- This IS expected if you are initializing AlbertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing AlbertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use AlbertModel for predictions without further training.

- This IS expected if you are initializing AlbertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing AlbertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).

If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use AlbertModel for predictions without further training.

[WARNING|modeling_utils.py:1328] 2023-08-28 11:31:24,145 >> Some weights of the model checkpoint at albert-large-v2 were not used when initializing AlbertModel: ['predictions.dense.bias', 'predictions.LayerNorm.weight', 'predictions.LayerNorm.bias', 'predictions.dense.weight', 'predictions.decoder.weight', 'predictions.decoder.bias', 'predictions.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing AlbertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing AlbertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
[INFO|modeling_utils.py:1345] 2023-08-28 11:31:24,145 >> All the weights of AlbertModel were initialized from the model checkpoint at albert-large-v2.
If your task is similar to the task the model of the checkpoint was trained on, you can already use AlbertModel for predictions without further training.
